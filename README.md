# Phonebook App

## Compromises

* Use of starter kit for solution to hit the ground running, https://github.com/kriasoft/aspnet-starter-kit, LICENSE.txt left intact to show credit.

## Happy With:
* Ability to use Singleton dependencies to create an in-memory data store.
* JavaScript serialization is as I'd like out of the box.

## Not Happy With:
* Use of hyphen in project name
* Namespacing of projects - would prefer for example `PhoneBook.Server.Interfaces` rather than `Server.Interfaces`.
* Still a lot of irrelevant code.
* C# development causes new windows to pop out on save, annoying!

## Time Spent

* Tues 19/09/2017 - 1 hour looking in to my options, no coding.
* Wed 20/09/2017 - 1 hour at lunch, making a start on the project, 2 hours in the evening.
